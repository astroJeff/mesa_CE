Most of the functions have been added to src_binary/private/binary_separation.f


Functions:
-check_CE
-check_merger
-accretor_mass_radius_relation
-calc_naive_A_f


Set defaults in defaults/binary_controls.defaults:

Adjustments to the makefile:
-binary_separation.f is included in $LIB_OBJS
-$LIB is changed from libbinary.a to libbinary_CE.a
-statement added: BINARY_INCLUDES = -I$(MOD_DEFAULTS_DIR)
-$(BINARY_INCLUDES) is now added to the “COMPILE =“ line
